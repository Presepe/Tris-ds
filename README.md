The code was written around the end of 2021 and the start of 2022.

At the time there wasn't any tool to easily code a ds game, or at least, they existed,
but for older os, and at the time the support for new os wasn't a thing and you had to do many work-around to get them to work,
so i wrote it in c++ found some libraries and compiled it with devkitpro.

i have another directory named tris2 and it has some changes in variables types, 
if i have time i will compare it and see if there are changes important enough to integrate them.

if i have time i will continue this code to implement new feature (like a decent graphic at least)

probably i've wasted too much time writing this description, because probably no one will read it, and because this is tic tac toe, not an algorithm to manage quantum computing.
